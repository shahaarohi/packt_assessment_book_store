# book-store

## Project Tech Stack 
- For Frontend I have used vue3 framework. 
- I have used mdb-vue-ui-kit package for UI design and components, which is based on Bootstrap 5. 
- I have used axios to make API calls. 

## Project Flow 
- On Base route I have listed all books, along with pagination and search functionality which is based on Meilisearch. 
- I have added one nav bar from there Admin user can navigate to login page
- Once Admin logged in they can access listing and add new book page 
- From listing page Admin can edit and delete existing books
- From add new book Admin can add new books
